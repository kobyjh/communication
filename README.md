Communication
=============

## Prefered methods of communication 

One of my issues with the preferred methods of communication is that if I wanted to see you, say like in two days, and I tried to call or to write a letter, the delay time is so long that there is very little chance, come 24 hours later, that we would be able to schedule on such a short notice. The methods mixed with the response time doesn't allow for efficiency. I think we may need to break it down to two contexts: logistical communication vs. philosophical communication. What do you think? I will wait to add this aspect until I hear your thoughts. 

1. Written letter.
1. Face to face.
1. Phone call. (Voicemail only for proof of call 80% of time. However, if there is a voicemail, care should be taken to review it due to care taken to leave it.)
1. Email.
2. SMS

## Response time to communication request based on method of request

* Written letter: 5 days
* Face to face: 5 minutes
* Phone call: 24 hours
* Email: 12 hours
* SMS: 12 hours

## Standard times
I don't understand standard times. doesn't make sense - especially since there is a wide response time. hm. 
* 900-1030
* 1800-2000
